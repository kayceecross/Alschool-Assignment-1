  <u><h2>BIO</h2></u>

  <p>
    <h3>
      <font size="5"> Hello, Welcome to my page.</font></h3>
    
    <br>
   <font size="5"> My name is Kelechi Madubuko, I was born on the 19th of January, 1989 in Lagos Nigeria.
     I'm the second of six children. I'm a native of Aguata in Anambra state. I am about 6-feet tall and I weigh about 195 pounds.
     I have always been domiciled in Lagos as it is a city I have grown to have so much affection for despite the fast-paced lifestyle.
     I consider myself as a friendly, open-minded person that is always ready to learn because I believe education never ends.

   <u><h2>EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND</h2></u>

   <p>
    <font size="5"> I had my primary and secondary education in Lagos, before i proceeded to study Electrical/Electronics Engineering
      (Electronics/Telecommunication major), from the prestigious Anambra State University(now Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University), 
      located in Anambra state. I graduated in the year 2011 with a BEng degree, Second class(Lower division) Honors. I completed my 
      mandatory one year youth service in Edo state, 2013.

   <u><h2>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</h2></u>

   <p>
    <font size="5">
      Immediately after my NYSC, I resumed job as a Marketing Manager for an automotive spare parts dealership company, after a brief 
      stint of six months, I was promoted to a Branch Manager. I went on to found my own automotive spare parts dealership with the
      support of my boss, which I run till date

   <u><h2>VISION FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL</h2></u>

   <p>
    <font size="5"> The world is a global village, and is becoming more technologically advanced by the day. As a matter of fact, the world in the last
    decade has witnessed such a terrific increase in the adaptation of recent technology, including AI/ML, that it would be quite absurd
    for someone like me with a prior background in engineering to sit back and watch the world metamorphose so rapidly without
    being an active player in the quest to change the world for better. I have always had the intention of becoming a world-class engineer
    but lacked the willpower to go ahead with my aspirations. Behold, then came Altschool with an affordable yet properly structured offer.
    I had no option but to grab the opportunity with both hands as I realised Altschool has all it takes to make me a world-class engineer.
    I realised this was the golden opportunity I've always waited for to begin my journey towards being a software engineer.

   <u><h2>MISSION FOR JOINING ALTSCHOOL</h2></u>

   <p>
    <font size="5">
      My affinity for technology has made it imperative that I master the art of problem solving, that's what software engineering entiails anyway.
      I hope that by the time I'm through with my Diploma program in Altschool, I would have mastered the basic principles of software emgineering, 
      Cloud/Devops precisely, and would then go ahead to hone the skills I must have acquired as a world-class software engineer through internships
      and collaborative efforts with the wonderful community here in Altschool. Finally, I intend to apply the knowledge gained from Altschool in
      solving real-time world problems and make people happier with technology.
